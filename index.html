    <p>I am a first time coder, but it was always something that I was interested in.  I was in Social Services for many years, but a series of
       unfortunate <em>events</em> left me unable to continue in the field. I turned and made the j<sup>u<sup>m</sup>p</sup> to reinvent myself, and here I am in
       the <a class="class1">Cleveland Codes Program!</a></p>
	   
    <p>My hobby is narrating short stories.  I love to see, hear, or read reactions to the audio.  I narrate all kinds of fiction.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Horror</li>
        <li>Fantasy</li>
        <li><abbr title="Science fiction">Sci-Fi</abbr></li>
        <li>Romance</li>
    </ul>
	
    <p>I'm game for anything as long as the story is interesting! I'd be glad to do a narration for anyone.  <br />

	<h2>About Family...</h2>
	
   
	
	<p>One of the most <b>important</b> things in my life is my family. It has been my honor and privilege to be a father and husband. Raising seven children is not 
    without its challenges but it has been the highlight of my time here on earth! I was married on the 14<sup>th</sup> of November in 1998 and it has been 
	one <strong>heck</strong> of a ride.</p>
	 
	<p>Desmond Tutu once said...
	   <blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/desmond_tutu">
       <i>You don't choose your family. They are God's gift to you, as you are to them.</i>
       </blockquote>
	   
    I couldn't agree more! From the day I started my family, it has been a non-stop <a id="first">roller-coaster</a> filled with every emotion imaginable! And I wouldn't change a thing!

	<h2>About School...</h2>
	
	<p>Although I've always wanted to code, I've never taken it seriously until recently.  I've done minor coding on different software platforms but never looked into
	the meat of the industry.  After taking a hard look at it, I realized that this was the place I should have been a long time ago.  I was fortunate enough to be
	admitted to the Cleveland Codes fifth Cohort and it has been great.  In just a short time I've learned so much and am eager to learn more.  The instructional 
	material is so interesting and my instructor is knowledgeable and patient with his students.  I'm so glad that I took this course.  <a class="class1">I've found my passion.</a>
